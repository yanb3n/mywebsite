## Background: Scammers on Facebook Marketplace  

Several months ago a friend posted their journey of pulling a Marie Kondo and cleaning house a bit, inspiring me to do a bit of the same for my small apartment. I posted an assortment items for sale and waited for responses. To my surprise, I received a consistent stream of scam messages offering to preemptively pay for my item via [Zelle](zellepay.com) that are reminiscent of [call center scams](https://youtu.be/xsLJZyih3Ac?t=107) that ask you to "refund the difference" for an "overpayment." Though there are [plenty](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2022-10-07/zelle-banks-may-not-cover-the-losses-from-scams) [of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/10/12/how-scammers-target-zelle-users-stay-safe/) [articles](https://www.zellepay.com/financial-education/pay-it-safe/understanding-fraud-scams) [documenting](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/banking/dont-get-fooled-by-zelle-scams-how-they-work-and-how-to-protect-yourself) this type of scam, I was underwhelmed by the amount of documentation of what the scam actually looks like (screenshots, emails, etc.) and took it upon myself to write something up. 

## Anatomy of a Scam
In my ~month of messing with scammers I've run into two variants:
1. Scammer fakes payment, requests item to be mailed (hereafter known as Mail Scam) 
2. Scammer fakes overpayment, requests a refund (hereafter known as Refund Scam) 

Let's break them down.

## Mail Scam 

The mail scam is the simpler of the two and attempts to steal the item you're selling directly. In my given example, the scammer contacts you about your item listing, sends you a fake payment confirmation, and requests the item to be mailed out. 

A typical initial contact looks as follows (with necessary PII redactions ofc):
